Sunshine pouring through the window
Diffusion through the blinds
Sat here at the computer desk
Pondering my rhymes 

Thinking about all of the words
Many that I know
Putting them all together
And updating my repo

I hope my time that I will spend
Writing every word
Does not go to waste at all
Or else I'll go absurd!

Lemons, Lemons, everywhere
but never should you drink
For sour are their juices now
unless you grow them pink
