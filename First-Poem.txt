Sunshine pouring through the window
Diffusion through the blinds
Sat here at the computer desk
Pondering my rhymes 

Thinking about all of the words
Many that I know
Putting them all together
And updating my repo

I hope my time that I will spend
Writing every word
Does not go to waste at all
Or else I'll go absurd!
